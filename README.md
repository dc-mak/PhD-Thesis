Dhruv Makwana's PhD thesis
===

[![CI](https://github.com/dc-mak/PhD-Thesis/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/dc-mak/PhD-Thesis/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

This is the source for my PhD thesis. It owes a lot to [Meven Lennon-Bertand's
thesis](https://github.com/MevenBertrand/PhD-Thesis/), which is itself based on
the [kaobook template](https://github.com/fmarotta/kaobook). Many thanks to Meven
and the rest of the kaobook contributors!

Feedback

Any feedback is extremely welcome, from tiny typos to "you should definitely
change the structure of the whole thing". You can either open an issue directly
here, or send me an email or message of some kind.
